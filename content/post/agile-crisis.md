The Agile Crisis

<!--more-->

[The Agile Crisis — a Primer – Jan Wischweh – Medium](http://bit.ly/2uMyxYt)

tl;dr:

	1. Agile is a mindset, and Scrum is a project management
	2. If Scrum fails then it's wrong Scrum (no true Scrum)
	3. Imbalance of power between product owners and developers
	4. Software development is not an assembly line (yet?)
